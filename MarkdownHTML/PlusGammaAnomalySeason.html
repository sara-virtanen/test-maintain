<p>From January to March, Agents can take part in the <strong>+Gamma</strong> Anomaly Season, competing across multiple Events to earn the most Season Points for their Faction.</p>
<p>In addition, by taking part in some of these Events, Agents have multiple opportunities to earn medals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>+Gamma Season Medal (3-tiered): Awarded based on participation in Ingress First Saturday events and performance in both Global Campaign and Anomaly battles.</p>
<p><em>Note: The Gold tier is reachable without attending any IFS events, provided performance in the Global Campaign and Anomaly battles is maximized.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Commemorative +Gamma Onsite Medal (single-tiered): Earned simply by participating in any Anomaly battle onsite.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Global Campaign Medal (3-tiered): Based solely on performance during the Global Campaign.</p>
</li>
</ul>
