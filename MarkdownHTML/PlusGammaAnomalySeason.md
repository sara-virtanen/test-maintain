![+Gamma Anomaly Season](Images/GammaAnomalySeason.png)

From January to March, Agents can take part in the **+Gamma** Anomaly Season, competing across multiple Events to earn the most Season Points for their Faction.

In addition, by taking part in some of these Events, Agents have multiple opportunities to earn medals.

* +Gamma Season Medal (3-tiered): Awarded based on participation in Ingress First Saturday events and performance in both Global Campaign and Anomaly battles.
  
  *Note: The Gold tier is reachable without attending any IFS events, provided performance in the Global Campaign and Anomaly battles is maximized.*
* Commemorative +Gamma Onsite Medal (single-tiered): Earned simply by participating in any Anomaly battle onsite.
* Global Campaign Medal (3-tiered): Based solely on performance during the Global Campaign.
